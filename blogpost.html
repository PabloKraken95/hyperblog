                    This is the attractive and interesting title of the 
                    post
                </h1>

                    And this is the initial paragraph where we're going 
                    to explain the incredible things you can do with

                    Blogs are the best way to share information and your
                    own ideas. Even better than going to conferences or 
                    beign in Youtube. Except if you're a Rockstar. But 
                    statiscally speaking, you're not... for now at least.
